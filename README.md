A minimalist password manager for Mac.

Designed for speed of access, ease of use, and simplicity.

Can be run simply with:

~~~~
$ python main.py
~~~~

Open the program and go to PWman->About to read more. Enjoy! :)

Check out a packaged version (tested on OS X 10.9, should work for OS X 10.7+) at http://gregdmeyer.github.io/PWman.html

Only copy/paste functions are not portable to Linux... replacing copypaste.py can make it run there as well.

Disclaimer: I am not a professional cryptographer. AES-256 is an extremely secure cryptosystem, but side channel attacks are possible if someone cared enough to try. This program is not meant to be used to store crucial information. Feel free to use it to store passwords for, say, Twitter or Project Euler. Do NOT use it to store passwords for e.g. your bank!
