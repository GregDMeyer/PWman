[NOT MAINTAINED]

A minimalist password manager.

Designed for speed of access, ease of use, and simplicity.

Can be run simply with:

~~~~
$ python main.py
~~~~

All you need to run it is `pycrypto` and `Tkinter`.

Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04.
Probably works on OS X too. (if not, only need to change the copy/paste functions)

Disclaimer: I am not a professional cryptographer. AES-256 is an extremely secure cryptosystem, but side channel attacks are possible if someone cared enough to try. This program is not meant to be used to store crucial information. Feel free to use it to store passwords for, say, Twitter or Project Euler. Do NOT use it to store passwords for e.g. your bank!
